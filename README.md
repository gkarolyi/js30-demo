# README

A simple Rails app to demo my progress in the [JavaScript30 course](https://javascript30.com/) by Wes Bos, built on `Ruby on Rails` with `HTML/HAML`, `SCSS`, `TailwindCSS 2.0`, and vanilla `ES6 JavaScript`! Deployed [here on Heroku](https://gkarolyi-js30.herokuapp.com/).

This course is a great opportunity to practice JavaScript by creating many interesting mini-projects, and I thought I'd tie it together with practicing Rails and learning some other interesting things as well at the same time.
